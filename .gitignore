Of course. Deploying to Vercel is an excellent choice. A well-configured .gitignore file is crucial, especially to prevent sensitive information like API keys from being exposed.

Your current .gitignore file has a few entries that should be adjusted for a standard deployment. For example, package-lock.json should be committed to ensure Vercel uses the exact same dependency versions as your local machine, and your .env file with API keys must be ignored for security.

Here is the recommended .gitignore file for your project.
